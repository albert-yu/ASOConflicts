# ASOConflicts

Every time a conflict is submitted:

1. A student submits a conflict through this Google form: http://goo.gl/forms/ZXgfDGDu3d

2. The answer is recorded in a Google spreadsheet, and a Google script (not mine, but I modified it) automatically sends an email to my boss with the information in the conflict.

Twice every week:

3. Google spreadsheet is downloaded as a csv file.

4. Script parses csv and records the response in a table in a Word document.
